  <title>Suggestions for Success</title>

  <p>
    First and foremost: <em>I want you to succeed</em>.
    I am here to help you learn and grow as a mathematician.
    I also know that this isn't always easy.
    Here are a few things to keep in mind when you are feeling stuck or overwhelmed.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <title>Ask questions</title>

        <p>
          Perhaps the single most important skill you can learn is how to ask questions.
          Think of question-asking not so much as a way to get answers, but as a way to clarify your thinking.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <title>Ask for help</title>

        <p>
          Don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it.
          Whether it's from me, your classmates, or other resources, there are many opportunities for support.
          I have regular student hours and am happy to schedule additional time as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also take advantage of the Math Study Center in Ross 1250 for drop-in tutoring and the UNC Tutoring Center in Michener L149 which provides free peer-led tutoring services by appointment.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <title>Embrace the struggle</title>

        <p>
          Learning mathematics can be challenging, but that is exactly what makes it so valuable.
          You wouldn't go to the gym and lift 1lb weights every day and expect massive gains (as the kids say).
          Instead, you need to push yourself, take on more challenging problems, and be willing to struggle a bit in order to grow.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <title>Help each other learn</title>

        <p>
          Collaboration is key to success in mathematics.
          Work together with your classmates, share your insights, and learn from one another.
          Teaching a concept to someone else is often the best way to solidify your own understanding.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    I also want to acknowledge that there are often external factors that can impact your opportunity to learn.
    Below are some resources offered through UNC that may be helpful.

    <title>Food Insecurity, Housing Insecurity, and Other Essential Needs</title>

    <p>
      Significant numbers of UNC students are challenged in getting enough food to eat.
      Others have difficulty finding safe and stable housing or meeting other essential needs, such as medical and mental healthcare, childcare and transportation.
      Still others face financial crises in the wake of unexpected emergencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through its <url href="https://www.unco.edu/center-student-well-being/">Center for Student Well-Being</url> (CSW, located on the lower floor of the UC), UNC offers personalized 1-on-1 assistance to students facing food insecurity, housing insecurity, financial emergencies or other basic needs challenges.
      UNC also provides students with access to several food resource programs on campus, including the <url href="http://www.unco.edu/bear-pantry">Bear Pantry</url>, where students can access food and hygiene items at no cost.
      Resource navigators in the CSW can also help students gain access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other resources.
