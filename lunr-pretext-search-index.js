Student Hours  Tu\/Th 10-11am; Wed 10:30-11:30am.  Additional times by appointment.    Class Meetings  Thursdays 12:30-1:45pm in Ross Hall 2090.    Course Description  Provides support for students taking Calculus I by reviewing and exploring important prerequisite concepts required for calculus in a timely manner. Topics include relevant areas of algebra, trigonometry and pre-calculus.    Co-requisite  Concurrent enrollment in MATH 131 or MATH 171 required.    Textbook and Course Materials  No textbook required.  All course materials will be available through Canvas.      Course Objectives  The goal of this course is to help you master the basic skills and concepts required to succeed in a calculus course. This includes increasing your proficiency at algebraic manipulation as well as your ability to interpret mathematical statements accurately and communicate mathematics effectively. Additionally, you will gain insight into the conceptual underpinnings of topics covered and develop productive strategies for studying calculus.     Assessments and Grades  Your grade for the course will be based on participation in class and effort to strengthen your skills outside of class.   Participation  This course is designed to help you be successful in Calculus I. It is intended to be a resource and I believe you will find the course useful and want to participate fully for that reason.  I understand though that you have lots of demands on your time, and that it can often help to have some explicit motivation to spend that time wisely. Therefor, I will assign a participation score for each week of class. Just showing up gets you half of the possible participation points. To earn the other half, I expect you to engage actively in class. This includes doing things like:   Ask questions. We know how hard this can be, but it is perhaps the single most important skill you can develop for a successful college experience.    Contribute to class discussions by answering questions and sharing your perspectives. Everyone in the class brings their own unique experiences and insights, and we want to hear from you!    Don't even try to multitask. Lots of research shows that basically no one is good at multitasking. Focus on what we are doing in class.     Your participation score will contribute 50% to your final grade.    Assignments  There are two sorts of tasks I will ask you to complete outside of class.  First, you will complete a very short discussion board post each week no later than Wednesday at 5pm. The prompt for this will always be the same: What is going well and what is going not-so-well in your Calculus course? What can we do to help support you in that class? . Responding to this prompt will help guide our discussion the following day. You will get full credit on this assignment if you submit it on time and answer honestly and thoughtfully.  Second, I will make a number of practice problems available through Canvas for you to bolster your algebraic skills to support your success in Calculus. You do not need to complete all the practice problems (some of them will be too easy for you, others might be too hard at first). All I ask of you is to spend an hour a week trying these. Doing this prior to the Wednesday discussion board post is a great way to identify what you might want additional assistance with in class (i.e., for you to use as your response on your post).  The combination of these two tasks will contribute the second 50% to your final grade.    Final Exam  There is no final exam for this course. However, the time reserved for the final exam is Tuesday, December 9 from 1:30pm to 4pm. Since this is prior to your Calculus final exam, I will hold a review session during this time. Attendance is optional but encouraged.    Grades     Assessment Weights  Your final grade will be calculated based on the following weights.     Participation  50%    Assignments  50%      Grade Scale  This course uses a Satisfactory\/Unsatisfactory (S\/U) grading scale, determined as follows.     S  65-100%    U  Below 65%          Course Policies   Attendance  You are expected to attend every class period. It is impossible to receive participation points if you are not in class.  But what happens if you absolutely cannot attend class? Maybe you are very ill, somebody has slashed your tires, and you are having a bad hair day! These things happen, and I will try to be understanding when you communicate with me about your situation. Please reach out to me as soon as possible to discuss your options.  One important note though: in this class, just like in every other class, missing a day of class, even with a perfectly valid excuse, does not excuse you from learning what was covered that day. As your instructor, I will try to help you catch up, but this will take more work than it would have if you were in class.    Late work  Late work will be accepted only under extenuating circumstances and must be discussed with me in advance. Deadlines are set to encourage you to stay on track with the course material and manage your time effectively. If you are struggling to meet a deadline, please reach out to me as soon as possible to discuss your options.    Classroom Decorum  Turn off your cell phones when in class and keep them put away, arrive on time, and do not pack up your things before the end of class. All of these are potential distractions to yourself and your classmates that could negatively impact your learning.  Additionally, I expect that you will treat all members of our course community with respect and kindness. In doing mathematics, or almost anything worth doing in life, you are going to make many errors and false starts while becoming more proficient. Think, for example, of learning to play a musical instrument, or learning an athletic skill, or developing a friendship. I want to establish a classroom atmosphere where the inevitable struggles and mistakes become an opportunity to learn and grow; not an opportunity for embarrassment. Thus, please be constructive and polite in questioning your colleagues in class.    Academic Integrity  It is expected that members of this class will observe strict policies of academic honesty in every aspect of this course. In particular, you are expected to solve homework problems by yourself or together with your group, and not find solutions online. In general, UNC's policies and recommendations for academic misconduct will be followed. For additional information, please see the Student Code of Conduct at the Dean of Student's website http:\/\/www.unco.edu\/dos\/Conduct\/codeofconduct.html .    Generative AI  The use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or CoPilot) is allowed in this course, but it is your responsibility to ensure that you use of these tools with academic integrity.  What does this mean? Ask yourself what you hope to get out of this course. We really hope your answer involves learning new skills, becoming a better thinker, and understanding mathematics at a deeper level (even if these goals are in service to eventually getting a better paying and more fulfilling job).  AI tools can help you achieve these goals. Here are a few example prompts that you might find useful and are completely inline with these goals.    I am trying to learn the concept . Give me a sample question and ask me to find the answer and explain how I found it to you. Then ask me some followup questions, acting like a student I am tutoring on the topic. Make sure I can explain everything sufficiently so you can understand the concepts involved.      My professor gave me this sample quiz question: . Generate 5 additional questions that are similar in style and difficulty and ask me to give you the answers. Don't give me solutions until I have done so, but point out any errors I might have made.      Here is an example from my textbook: . Make up a similar question and walk me through a solution step my step, asking me to ask questions after each step to make sure I really understand the process.       Warning: As good as AI has become recently, it is still not great at mathematics, so anything you get out of a generative AI tool should be approached with a fair amount of skepticism. This is also a good way to learn mathematics though: play find the mistake in what AI gives you!  To be clear, you should NOT use AI tools to shortcut the learning process. Getting someone else to do your work for you (even if that someone is a robot) is plagiarism and a violation of the academic integrity policy.    Title IX and Equal Opportunity  The University of Northern Colorado is committed to providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students that is free from discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. Students who have experienced (or who know someone who has experienced) any of these concerns should know that they are not alone. UNC has staff members in the University's Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) who are trained to support students in navigating these concerns and are able to provide on- and off-campus resources and supports, referrals to health and counseling services, academic and housing modifications, and mutual no-contact orders between individuals.  Please be aware all UNC instructors and most staff members are required to report their awareness of sexual misconduct to the OIEC. This means that if students tell an instructor about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the instructor must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator and Equity Officer, Jimmy Kohles. Mr. Kohles or a trained staff member in OIEC will contact the reporting students to let them know about resources and support services at UNC as well as their options to pursue an investigation through OIEC, law enforcement, or both. Students who have experienced these types of incidents are not required to speak with OIEC staff regarding the incident. Students' participation in OIEC processes are entirely voluntary.  If students do not want the Title IX Coordinator notified, instead of disclosing this information to the instructor, students can speak confidentially with the following people on campus and in the community. They can connect you with support services and help explore options now, or in the future. UNC has confidential victim advocates available 24\/7 by phone - students can contact the Assault Survivors Advocacy Program (ASAP) at 970-351-1490 to seek confidential guidance and support.     Suggestions for Success  First and foremost: I want you to succeed . I am here to help you learn and grow as a mathematician. I also know that this isn't always easy. Here are a few things to keep in mind when you are feeling stuck or overwhelmed.   Ask questions  Perhaps the single most important skill you can learn is how to ask questions. Think of question-asking not so much as a way to get answers, but as a way to clarify your thinking.    Ask for help  Don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it. Whether it's from me, your classmates, or other resources, there are many opportunities for support. I have regular student hours and am happy to schedule additional time as well.  You can also take advantage of the Math Study Center in Ross 1250 for drop-in tutoring and the UNC Tutoring Center in Michener L149 which provides free peer-led tutoring services by appointment.    Embrace the struggle  Learning mathematics can be challenging, but that is exactly what makes it so valuable. You wouldn't go to the gym and lift 1lb weights every day and expect massive gains (as the kids say). Instead, you need to push yourself, take on more challenging problems, and be willing to struggle a bit in order to grow.    Help each other learn  Collaboration is key to success in mathematics. Work together with your classmates, share your insights, and learn from one another. Teaching a concept to someone else is often the best way to solidify your own understanding.     I also want to acknowledge that there are often external factors that can impact your opportunity to learn. Below are some resources offered through UNC that may be helpful.   Disability Resources  My goal is to co-create a learning space that is inclusive and responsive to your access needs. If you anticipate or experience barriers to full participation in this course for any reason, please connect with me. Whether it's related to course design, content delivery, or materials, I welcome that dialogue.  If you are connected with the Disability Resource Center (DRC), please share your accommodation letter early so we can plan together.  If you are not yet connected but would like to explore accommodations or access resources, you can contact the Disability Resource Center: 970-351-2289, drc@unco.edu , Michener L-80, www.unco.edu\/disability-resource-center .    Food Insecurity, Housing Insecurity, and Other Essential Needs  Significant numbers of UNC students are challenged in getting enough food to eat. Others have difficulty finding safe and stable housing or meeting other essential needs, such as medical and mental healthcare, childcare and transportation. Still others face financial crises in the wake of unexpected emergencies.  Through its Center for Student Well-Being (CSW, located on the lower floor of the UC), UNC offers personalized 1-on-1 assistance to students facing food insecurity, housing insecurity, financial emergencies or other basic needs challenges. UNC also provides students with access to several food resource programs on campus, including the Bear Pantry , where students can access food and hygiene items at no cost. Resource navigators in the CSW can also help students gain access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other resources.    Student Well-being  If you're not sure where to turn, the website for UNC's Student Outreach and Case Management office lists a wide variety of resources for students. Case Managers can assist students during difficult circumstances which may include medical, mental health, personal or family crisis, and illness or injury.  Mental health professionals are available on-campus and in the community. See a wide variety of on- and off-campus resources on the Dean of Student's webpage .  For free, confidential consultations, check out the Counseling Center . To access staff in the Counseling Center, call 970-351-2496 or stop by the Center, located on the second floor of Cassidy Hall.  If you or someone else is experiencing a crisis or suicidal thoughts and the Counseling Center is not available (including evenings, weekends, and holidays), contact either North Range Behavioral Health by calling 844-493-TALK (8255) or text TALK to 38255 or the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.
